## Satoshi Nakamoto
Satoshi Nakamoto is the inventor (or inventors) of Bitcoin. In October of 2008, Nakamoto released a paper called [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). It was posted on a mailing list where he claimed

>I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.

In January 2009 the first bitcoin software was released. It launched the network and the first units of the bitcoin cryptocurrency, called bitcoins. 

## What is Bitcoin?
It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called "cryptocurrency", a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than a central authority. 
As anything digital can be copied many times the hard part of making a digital payment system is making sure that nobody spends the same money more than once. Normally you need a trusted central authority (like a bank) to verify that doesn't happen. Bitcoin is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.

## who controls it?
Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.

## How it works
From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that provides a personal Bitcoin wallet and allows a user to send and receive bitcoins with them. This is how Bitcoin works for most users.

Behind the scenes, the Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger called the "block chain". This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending bitcoins from their own Bitcoin addresses. In addition, anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is often called "mining".
