## What is Qtum?
Qtum is an open source Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain application platform. Qtum’s core technology combines a fork of Bitcoin Core, an Account Abstraction Layer allowing for multiple Virtual Machines including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Proof-of-Stake consensus aimed at tackling industry use cases. 

## Techical Aspects
Building on Bitcoin’s reliable and proven-to-deliver blockchain, Qtum stacks its Account Abstraction Layer, allowing the Bitcoin Core 0.13 blockchain to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run DApps, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for Ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem.
>We believe this will allow Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (DApps) to run on a familiar foundation, while offering a robust environment for developers. The underlying technology uses an “Account Abstraction Layer”, which acts as a bridge between the EVM and the Unspent Transaction Output model of Bitcoin Core.

Designed with stability, modularity and interoperability in mind, Qtum is the foremost toolkit for building trusted decentralized applications, suited for real-world, business oriented use cases. Its hybrid nature, in combination with a first-of-its-kind PoS consensus protocol, allow Qtum applications to be compatible with major blockchain ecosystems, while providing native support for mobile devices and IoT appliances.
