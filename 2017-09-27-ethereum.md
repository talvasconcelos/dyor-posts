## What is Ethereum?
In late 2013, Vitalik Buterin released the initial white paper of what he called a "next-generation cryptocurrency and decentralised application platform", called Ethereum. Buterin explained that, unlike all of the protocols designed earlier to meet specific needs of specific industries, the project developed by him and his colleagues was intended to be "as generalised as possible," enabling anyone to create specialised applications "for almost any purpose imaginable". Ethereum presented the potential to build decentralized applications, DApps. Ethereum is an alternative protocol that would enable smart contracts (“applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference”) both for financial and non-financial purposes. 

One of the main reasons so many programmers and developers continue to flock towards Ethereum is that the currency represents a revolution in the way that people view the blockchain. Ethereum allows programmers to run their own programs and software on the Ethereum network. More importantly, it allows programmers to convert other programs in separate programming languages into usable, blockchain-enabled programs. As a result, the entire process of creating a blockchain program has been overhauled, made ten times easier by Ethereum. This innovation lends several real-world industries a potentially revolutionary opportunity.

On July 2015 Ethereum's live blockchain launched. The currency unit for the blockchain called Ether, had been crowdsaled beforehand in a 42-day public round. The unit, exchangeable to [Bitcoin](2017-09-26-bitcoin) cryptocurrency, is described as a “fuel” for the platform rather than digital money, and was not initially intended to be used as currency, asset or share

## Ethereum Virtual Machine - EVM
The Ethereum Virtual Machine has been called the greatest innovation of Ethereum. This program is the one that makes it all happen. This Turing-complete software operates entirely on the Ethereum network. It allows any programmer to run any program, regardless of the language it was written in, on the Ethereum network. This means that virtually any program, if given enough time and memory, can be changed into a decentralized program with all the security benefits of a program with blockchain technology.

Instead of creating a new blockchain, those looking to run their new program can simply plug it into the Ethereum Virtual Machine and convert their work into a usable entity on the Ethereum network.
