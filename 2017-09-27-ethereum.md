## What is Ethereum?
In late 2013, Vitalik Buterin released the initial white paper of what he called a "next-generation cryptocurrency and decentralised application platform", called Ethereum. Buterin explained that, unlike all of the protocols designed earlier to meet specific needs of specific industries, the project developed by him and his colleagues was intended to be "as generalised as possible," enabling anyone to create specialised applications "for almost any purpose imaginable". Ethereum presented the potential to build decentralized applications, DApps. Ethereum is an alternative protocol that would enable smart contracts (“applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference”) both for financial and non-financial purposes. 

One of the main reasons so many programmers and developers continue to flock towards Ethereum is that the currency represents a revolution in the way that people view the blockchain. Ethereum allows programmers to run their own programs and software on the Ethereum network. More importantly, it allows programmers to convert other programs in separate programming languages into usable, blockchain-enabled programs. As a result, the entire process of creating a blockchain program has been overhauled, made ten times easier by Ethereum. This innovation lends several real-world industries a potentially revolutionary opportunity.

On July 2015 Ethereum's live blockchain launched. The currency unit for the blockchain called Ether, had been crowdsaled beforehand in a 42-day public round. The unit, exchangeable to [Bitcoin](2017-09-26-bitcoin) cryptocurrency, is described as a “fuel” for the platform rather than digital money, and was not initially intended to be used as currency, asset or share

## Ethereum Virtual Machine - EVM
The Ethereum Virtual Machine has been called the greatest innovation of Ethereum. This program is the one that makes it all happen. This Turing-complete software operates entirely on the Ethereum network. It allows any programmer to run any program, regardless of the language it was written in, on the Ethereum network. This means that virtually any program, if given enough time and memory, can be changed into a decentralized program with all the security benefits of a program with blockchain technology.

Instead of creating a new blockchain, those looking to run their new program can simply plug it into the Ethereum Virtual Machine and convert their work into a usable entity on the Ethereum network.

## So What Is a Smart Contract?
Smart contracts help you exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman.

The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a notary, pay them, and wait while you get the document. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your escrow, driver’s license, or whatever, drops into your account. More so, smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations.

>In a smart contract approach, an asset or currency is transferred into a program “and the program runs this code and at some point it automatically validates a condition and it automatically determines whether the asset should go to one person or back to the other person, or whether it should be immediately refunded to the person who sent it or some combination thereof.”In the meantime, the decentralized ledger also stores and replicates the document which gives it a certain security and immutability. - Vitalik Buterin

### Examples:
Imagine you want to rent your house. Ordinarily, you’d need to pay a middleman such as a realtor or a newspaper to advertise and then again you’d need to pay someone to confirm that the person paid rent and followed through. The blockchain/ledger cuts your costs. All you do is pay via token (bitcoin, ether, or whatever currency agreed on) and encode your contract on the ledger. Everyone sees, and you accomplish automatic fulfillment.

__Smart contracts bring you:__
* Autonomy – You’re the one making the agreement; there’s no need to rely on a broker, lawyer or other intermediaries to confirm. Incidentally, this also knocks out the danger of manipulation by a third party, since execution is managed automatically by the network, rather than by one or more, possibly biased, individuals who may err.
* Trust – Your documents are encrypted on a shared ledger.  There’s no way that someone can say they lost it.
* Backup – Imagine if your bank lost your savings account. On the blockchain, each and every one of your friends has your back. Your documents are duplicated many times over.
* Safety – Cryptography, the encryption of websites, keeps your documents safe. There is no hacking. In fact, it would take an abnormally smart hacker to crack the code and infiltrate.
* Speed – You’d ordinarily have to spend chunks of time and paperwork to manually process documents. Smart contracts use software code to automate tasks, thereby shaving hours off a range of business processes.
* Savings – Smart contracts save you money since they knock out the presence of an intermediary. You would, for instance, have to pay a notary to witness your transaction.
* Accuracy – Automated contracts are not only faster and cheaper but also avoid the errors that come from manually filling out heaps of forms.

__You can build:__
* A virtual organization where members vote on issues
* A transparent association based on shareholder voting
* Your own country with an unchangeable constitution
* A better delegative democracy

The "invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level" are only the very few options, "the only limit will be our imagination".
