## What is Qtum?
Qtum is an open source Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain application platform. Qtum’s core technology combines a fork of Bitcoin Core, an Account Abstraction Layer allowing for multiple Virtual Machines including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Proof-of-Stake consensus aimed at tackling industry use cases. Main network was live in September 13, 2017.

## Techical Aspects
Building on Bitcoin’s reliable and proven-to-deliver blockchain, Qtum stacks its Account Abstraction Layer, allowing the Bitcoin Core 0.13 blockchain to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run DApps, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for Ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem.
>We believe this will allow Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (DApps) to run on a familiar foundation, while offering a robust environment for developers. The underlying technology uses an “Account Abstraction Layer”, which acts as a bridge between the EVM and the Unspent Transaction Output model of Bitcoin Core.

Designed with stability, modularity and interoperability in mind, Qtum is the foremost toolkit for building trusted decentralized applications, suited for real-world, business oriented use cases. Its hybrid nature, in combination with a first-of-its-kind PoS consensus protocol, allow Qtum applications to be compatible with major blockchain ecosystems, while providing native support for mobile devices and IoT appliances.

## What's this PoS - Proof of Stake
>The probability of staking a block is based on how many tokens you have and how many others are securing the network. The block time is about 2 minutes, meaning there will be about 720 blocks per day, so it's just a numbers game. If you have 10,000 tokens, and only 10 million other tokens are participating in the staking process your chances of getting a block are pretty high. - Brett Fincaryk (Qtum Community Manager)

Proof of stake means that there's is no mining of Qtum. Anyone with any amount of coins will be able to run a node, create a new block in the blockchain and get block reward. Chances will be bigger the more coins you hold. You need to have your tokens on the wallet and set it to stake. After the 500 blocks maturity period you will be staking. The formula is: TotalAmountInStaking / YourAmountInStaking every 2 minutes. There's 720 blocks generated every day and the reward is 4 Qtum. After you generate a block and receive your 4 Qtum reward, you go through another maturity process before you can stake again. This prevents someone with large amounts of tokens to generate block after block. There will be a token swap in October 4 and from that moment on you can stake Qtum.

>The swap from ERC-20 tokens to Qtum’s functional network tokens will take place on October 4th 2017, 06:00 PM PT
The team announced that is better to move your tokens to an exchange and they will automatically swap the tokens and you won’t have to do any additional operation. Users’ Qtum exchange balance totals will reflect the same total that they had prior to the swap in a 1:1 manner.

## Smart Contracts that Mean Business
Qtum, in cooperation with its academic partners, develops tools and methods to standardize the workflow for business smart contract development. This includes the formally verifiable translation of human-readable agreements to machine smart contracts, and the error-resilient specification of their elements, terms and conditions.

Cooperating with a series of partners and third parties, Qtum aims to establish a smart contract hub, offering secure and thoroughly tested contract templates, tailor fitted for a multitude of industries and use cases, such as supply chain management, telecommunications, IoT, social networking, and many more.

Qtum is compatible with existing Ethereum contracts as well as Bitcoin gateways, and will maintain backward-compatibility even if the system is updated.

## Mobile

Building on Bitcoin’s UTXO model, the simple payment verification (SPV) protocol is supported by the Qtum codebase by default. As a result, it is now possible to execute smart contracts from lite wallets, which can be easily installed on any given mobile device, heralding an age of mobile decentralized applications. With this, the blockchain is finally ready to take up disruption in a world in which half of all internet traffic is being generated by smartphones and tablets.

## Space crypto
The Satellite launch is next year (2018). This is to protect the platform even in case of Internet ban. There might not be any official statement because it can also get cancelled because of various reasons. But this is in the roadmap and it has been confirmed.
