## What is Komodo
The Komodo Platform focuses on providing complete end-to-end blockchain solutions for developers of any level and any industry. It is simple yet powerful, offering customized blockchain solutions that are easy to deploy, and configurable to meet your needs. Their vision is to build a robust ecosystem of partners and developers, where together they can create an environment that accelerates anyone’s journey into blockchain technology.

The project’s primary goal is to decentralize token/coin issuance, exchange, and distribution. However, it also provides a framework for dapps (decentralized apps) and corporate blockchain solutions. It has accomplished this by introducing one of the most complete and trustless ecosystems in cryptocurrency. Komodo Platform is the first cryptocurrency project to provide decentralized atomic swaps with automatic decentralized order matching.
It is also the first project to create a private ICO participation mechanism and distribution by leveraging Jumblr and BarterDEX technology (dICO).
