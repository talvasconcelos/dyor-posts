## What is Waltonchain?
The main aim of the Walton Chain is to combine both RFID and blockchain technology. At present, RFID technology is widely used in various applications all over the world, from identification to freeway billing, mobile payment, credit card payment, we can see RFID everywhere. Waltonchain leverages the IoT (Internet of Things) concept that connects physical things to the internet.



Internet of Things technology contains two meanings: first, the core and foundation of the IoT is still the __Internet__, the IoT is an extension of the Internet; second, the client side of the IoT extends to the information exchange and communication between any objects, which is so called object-to-object interrelation. 

Current IoT models are flawed because transactions can only be carried out under the same trust domain, which means devices must be verified under the same IoT service provider. This means current IoT models are not decentralized enough.

WaltonChain introduces a new concept, the "Value Internet of Things(VIoT)". The project introduces the block chain technology into the Internet of Things, to solve the problem of centralization facing the development process of it.
