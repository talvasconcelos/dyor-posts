## What is Waltonchain?
The main aim of the Walton Chain is to combine both RFID and blockchain technology. At present, RFID technology is widely used in various applications all over the world, from identification to freeway billing, mobile payment, credit card payment, we can see RFID everywhere. Waltonchain leverages the IoT (Internet of Things) concept that connects physical things to the internet.

The Walton software consists of the Waltonchain software system, the Walton protocol, and the Walton coin (WTC).

__Internet of Things__:
- The core and foundation of the IoT is still the Internet, the IoT is an extension of the Internet
- The client side of the IoT extends to the information exchange and communication between any objects, which is so called object-to-object interrelation.

Current IoT models are flawed because transactions can only be carried out under the same trust domain, which means devices must be verified under the same IoT service provider. This means current IoT models are not decentralized enough.

WaltonChain introduces a new concept, the "Value Internet of Things(VIoT)". The project introduces the block chain technology into the Internet of Things and connect the devices to the network via RFID (radio frequency identification) technology, in order to solve the problem of centralization facing the development process of it.

__RFID__:

RFID technology works by attaching a digital identity to a real-world object. Current real world applications include the US Military tagging all supplies and some pharmaceutical companies tagging their products in order to identify counterfeits. In Waltonchain, RFID tag chips and RFID reader chips are utilized. The RFID tag is the device to be connected to the chain and the RFID reader is a node on the chain.

Using the RFID and WaltonChain can not only drastically reduce the data costs associated with production, warehousing, inspection, shipping, and retail but can also help consumers find the source of the products they are consuming.

## How does WaltonChain work?
The Waltonchain utilizes a Proof of Stake & Trust (PoST) consensus mechanism, an updated version of PoS. "*Walton constructed an innovative node reputation evaluation system*" which is PoS with adjustable difficulty for each node. Walton aims to choose more honest nodes in order to improve security.

The Walton ecosystem consists of the parent chain (Waltonchain), subchains, and the token used for payment and circulation (Waltoncoin). The Waltonchain started with the Walton Genesis Block and provides a number of functions including transaction management, subchain management, smart contracts, alias and asset control, etc...

In each step of the process information can be stored to the WaltonChain via the RFID.  This information is in the child chains storage and later can merge with the master chain. The child chain aids in increasing the speed and encryption process due to the strain associated with the master nodes.

As steps are completed the child and master nodes reach a consensus on the related information stored in the chain via the RFID that can recall and verify data it moves along from production to purchase.

Tags automatically generate random public keys and private keys, to ensure the security of Internet of Things applications, to ensure that the tag is unique, non-forgery and tamper-proof.

__WTC__ (Waltoncoin) is the cost paid by the transaction initiation node to the Accounting node. The accounting node can set the minimum price that can be accepted, and the transaction initiation node can set the maximum cost to be paid; when both conditions are met, the transaction will be successfully written to the block chain. These criteria are set to prevent spam, bloat, and bad actors from using the network as well as overseeing the fees associated with the technologies overhead.

## Real world use cases
As the market space that it can cover is in the trillions. WaltonChain will be applicable to multiple industries like, production, clothing, storage, store fronts and logistics. It is also expected to be in other fields like asset management and electronic licensing.

__A specific use case is presented in the [whitepaper](http://www.waltonchain.org/upload/1498826072890.pdf):__

Walton ecosystem applied to the clothing industry. An RFID is generated for each product and details are recorded on the blockchain. Information is updated on the blockchain during warehousing and transportation. Finally, it can be used to record the product in the store as well as customer information and preferences.

In more detail:
1. Production: The target product is produced and an RFID is generated for each product. This product will be recorded at each child node in the production. A master node will create a Production Block.

2. Warehousing: The product is stored in the warehouse after production, containing 3 sections: warehouse-in inspection, storage location, and warehouse-out inspection. Each section has an RFID reader to record the corresponding information and a Warehousing Block is created that will connect with the Production Block.

3. Logistics: Similar to the Warehousing node, recording the status of the product during transportation.

4. Stores: The node can be a store or a number of stores and will record the product as well as customer information and preferences.

__Other example:__

Imagine a customer in a grocery store and being able to verify that the orange picked up passed its inspection. They can confirm its potential expiration date, who cared for it, what chemicals are in the product and a multitude of other factors. At that moment you can choose if that product is right for you.

Also, this allows the grocery store to reject items that didnâ€™t have particular information present on their RFID to protect their customer. As WaltonChain's data is transparent, you can view the contents of the RFID at any time if you are in sync with the master chain.

The examples can extrapolate against hundred of industries from verifying the manufacturer for clothing, where a fish came from, libraries, warehousing, material management, construction, cleaning services, interactive marketing, or even tracking sports participants.  Walton Chain can be on anything that you would want to follow in the world either through its digital history or in real time.
